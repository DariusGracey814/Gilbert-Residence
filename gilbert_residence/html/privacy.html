The Gilbert Residence is committed to helping you maintain control over your personal data while fostering the growth of a more interactive, engaging, and personalized experience. We respect your right to control how much information you provide about yourself. The following Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from visitors to our web site (“Site”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through this Site and not to information collected offline. This Policy is effective as of May 1, 2018.

                    <p class="privacy__text">
                        We do not collect personally identifiable information on our Site unless you voluntarily provide information about yourself via an electronic mail message or by filling out one of our online forms. By “personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address or telephone number.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

                        Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <span class="privacy__span">Consumer Choice Page</span> or the NAI <span class="privacy__span">Consumer Opt-Out Page</span> will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective.

                    <h3 class="privacy__h3">3. How the Information You Provide is Used</h3>
                    <p class="privacy__text">
                        Should you send us your comments or questions via email to any email address provided on our Site, we will only share your communications with our employees most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in some cases, archive it. We will only disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. We do not sell, rent or otherwise disclose our mailing lists or other personally identifiable information you may provide without your consent.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="privacy__h3">4. Security of Information Sent to Us</h3>
                    <p class="privacy__text">
                        Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the email functionality on our Site does not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between us. Like all unencrypted Internet email communications, your email may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, BrightStar Care cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided throughout our Site.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="privacy__h3">5. Disclosure of Customer Information Through business Transfers</h3>
                    <p class="privacy__text">
                        As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the unlikely event that a portion or substantially all of the Gilbert Residence assets are sold or transferred to a third party, the information you have voluntarily provided to us, including your email address, would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
